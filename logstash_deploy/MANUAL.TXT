Instructions 

This document details how to use LogStash with Solr.  This release has been tested with:
 	Solr version 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0, 4.7.0, 4.8.1
 	LogStash version 1.3.3
 	Java 1.6.0

1) Create a collection to hold the log event data.  
   
   	It is now the expectation that the collection uses either a managed_schema or that the user has created an appropriate 
   	unmanaged schema for receipt of new fields.  With the exception of the two mandatory fields @timestamp and @version 
   	the application will not itself attempt to directly use the Solr api to explicitly create fields.
    
	For the mandatory fields @timestamp and @version the program will check for their existence at startup and if these fields 
   	do not exist then it will attempt to create them with the following types: 

	Timestamp
		type: tdate
		name: appends prefix value from config file or logstash_ by default to 'timestamp'. ex: logstash_timestamp
		stored: true
		indexed: true
	
	Version
		type: long
		name: appends prefix value from config file or logstash_ by default to 'version'.  ex: logstash_version
		stored: true
		indexed: true

	These type definitions can be changed in the file lucidworks_solr_lsv133.rb.    
	
	Setup a managed schema in solrconfig.xml file by including an active ManagedIndexSchemaFactory.  The xml file is located
	in the collection's conf directory. 
 
   Example:
	   <schemaFactory class="ManagedIndexSchemaFactory">
	      <bool name="mutable">true</bool>
	      <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>
	   </schemaFactory>

   An example collection folder named 'logstash_logs' is provided for use as a starter.  Note that it is 
   based on Solr version 4.4.0.  If you use a different version then you should use files from your distribution for your starting point.
   
   Copy the logstash_logs folder to the directory where your solr collections are stored.  With this 'skeleton' in place use the Solr admin tool 
   to create a new collection.  In the 'instance dir' field enter logstash_logs.  
   
   Example admin new core parameters:
   
       name: WhatEverNameYouLike
       instance_dir: logstash_logs
       dataDir: data
       config: solrconfig.xml
       schema: schema.xml
    
    Note that later versions of Solr automatically detect cores. Also, if you are running SolrCloud, you will need to either bootstrap the configuration at startup or upload the configuration to zookeeper and then specify it when creating a collection. 
 
2) Copy lucidworks.jar to the directory where you will execute the LogStash jar file (logstash-1.3.3-flatjar.jar or later). If you use the logstash_deploy directory as is this is already done for you.

3) Copy lucidworks_solr_lsv133.rb to your LogStash outputs directory.  This is typically in path "./<locationOfLogstashJar>/logstash/outputs". If you use the logstash_deploy directory as is this is already done for you.
   As the name indicates this version of the Ruby file is targeted at LogStash version 1.3.3.  
   
   The receive method converts the event argument received from LogStash into a hash of fieldname=fieldvalue pairs and passes this to
   lucidworks.jar. 
         
4) Add lucidworks_solr output definition to logstash configuration file.  An example file lw_solr_conf is included
   with the distribution.  To use, point the path parameter at your log file location.
   
	input {
   		file {
      		type => "syslog"
    		exclude => ["*.gz","*.zip","*.tgz"]
      		path => "/logfilePath/**/./*" 
			sincedb_path => "/dev/null"
    		start_position => "beginning"
    	}
  	}
	# Create fields for all name=value pairs found in message.  Add a new field and tag just for fun.
	filter {
		kv{
			add_field => [ "User_%{user}_says", "Hello world, from %{src_ip}" ]
	    add_tag => [ "tag", "you are it" ]
		}  
	}
	output {
	  	stdout { debug => true codec => "rubydebug"}
   		lucidworks_solr_lsv133 { collection_host => "localhost" collection_port => "8888" collection_name => "searchlogs" field_prefix => "event_" force_commit => false flush_size => 1000 idle_flush_time => 1 }
  	}


Where:
	output {
		lucidworks_solr_lsv133 {
	    	collection_host => ... # string (optional), default: "localhost"
			collection_port => ... # number (optional), default: 8983
			collection_name => ... # string (optional), default: "collection1"
			field_prefix => ... # string (optional), default: "logstash_"
			force_commit => ... # boolean (optional), default: false
			flush_size => ... # number (optional), default: 100
			idle_flush_time => ... # number (optional), default: 1
		}
	}
	
  	collection_host
  		Value type is string 
  		Default is localhost
  		 
  	Address of solr instance.  
  	
  	collection_port
  		Value type is string
  		Default is 8983
  		
  	Port for sending rest messages to solr instance.
  	
  	collection_name
  		Value type is string
  		Default is collection1
  		
  	Name of existent collection that will receive new documents. 
  	
   	field_prefix
   		Value type is string
   		Default is logstash_
   		
    LogStash @timestamp and @version will be renamed [field_prefix]timestamp and [field_prefix]version.
 
 	force_commit
		Value type is boolean
		Default is false
		
	If true then a commit request will be sent to Solr for each batch of documents uploaded.  If false then 
	the documents will be committed per the Solr instance's configured commit policy.
	
	The lucidworks_solr_lsv133 output uses Logstash's stud buffer to handle buffering events for batched document uploads.  The next two 
	field values get passed to the buffer manager.
	
	flush_size
	  Value type is number
	  Default is 100
	  
	Number of events to queue up before writing to Solr.  The implementation uses Logstash's stud event buffering.
	
	idle_flush_time
	  Value type is number
	  Default is 1
	  
	Amount of time in seconds since the last flush before a flush is done even if the number of buffered events is smaller than flush_size   
  
5) From within the directory where lucidworks.jar, dist subdirectory and logstash.jar are located execute LogStash.  
       Example: java -jar logstash-1.3.3-flatjar.jar agent -f lw_solr_conf -p .  

   If debug is true in the config files output then you should see each processed document's data displayed in the console window.
   Captured log data should now be in your Solr instance.
